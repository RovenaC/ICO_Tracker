# ICO Tracker:

Tracks and provides information on initial coin offerings (ICOs) and token sales...


In this detailed ICO Tracker code, i have implemented the following features.

__1. Data Retrieval:__

The scrape_icos method fetches ICO information from the specified website using web scraping techniques with the help of the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries. It populates the self.icos list with the extracted ICO data.

__2. Data Parsing:__

The parse_icos_from_website method extracts relevant ICO data from the website's HTML using BeautifulSoup. This method can be customized based on the specific HTML structure of the website you are scraping.

__3. Data Organization:__

The organize_icos method organizes ICO information in a structured manner. You can customize this method to sort, filter, or group ICOs based on your requirements.

__4. Data Presentation:__

The present_icos method presents the ICO information in an organized manner by printing the ICO details for each ICO in the self.icos list.
To use this code, replace the website_url variable with the actual URL of the website that provides ICO information. Additionally, implement the parse_icos_from_website method to extract relevant ICO data from the HTML of the website you are scraping.

Make sure you have the required libraries ``` requests``` , ``` bs4```  installed before running the code. You can install them using the following commands:

```
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

Please note that web scraping requires compliance with the website's terms of service and may be subject to rate limits or IP restrictions. Always review and respect the website's policies and robots.txt file before performing web scraping. Additionally, web scraping may break if the website's HTML structure changes, so you may need to update the parsing logic accordingly.
